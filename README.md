# ML-Without-Pipeline

This notebook demonstrates the use of SimpleImputer, OneHotEncoder, and Pickle in a ML project. The point of this study is to compare the similar problem with Pipelines. 

Here we can observe how difficult it is to use the model in production if the ML was designed without pipelines.
